  Web programmers oath
  - I will have my browser developer console open all the time
  - I progress with small steps
  - I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpoint problems
  If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working.
  When I ask for help in the course Discord or Telegram channel or elsewhere, I will formulate my questions properly. See here how to ask for help.
