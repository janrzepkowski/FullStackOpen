Full stack developer's oath

- I will have my browser developer console open all the time
- I will use the network tab of the browser dev tools to ensure that frontend and backend are communicating as I expect
- I will constantly keep an eye on the state of the server to make sure that the data sent there by the frontend is saved there as I expect
- I will progress with small steps
- I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpoint problems
- If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working

Famous software developer Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin has stated:
  "The only way to go fast is to go well."
