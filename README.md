  Web programmers oath
  - I will have my browser developer console open all the time
  - I progress with small steps
  - I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpoint problems
  - If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead, I start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working.

  Famous software developer Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin has stated:
  "The only way to go fast is to go well."
